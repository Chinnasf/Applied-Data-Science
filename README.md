# Applied Data Science
Here I store compelling codes on Applied Data Science in Python. 
My main objective is to keep uploading more complex analysis on several topics, as I keep learning on data analysis and machine learning.

### Content Description

The `Data` directory contains the free for use data needed in codes. 

`Detroit_Blight_Ticket_Compliance_GBC.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook which treats the 
[Detroit Blight Ticket Compliance Kaggle issue](https://www.kaggle.com/c/detroit-blight-ticket-compliance/overview). The solution is done using 
[Gradient Boost Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting). For the solution, I employ the python libraries `pandas`,`matplotlib`, `numpy`, and 
`sklearn`.
