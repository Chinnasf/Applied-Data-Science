# Applied Data Science

The objective is to keep uploading more complex analysis on several topics, as I keep learning on data analysis and machine learning.

### Content Description

There is a `Data` directory per directory in this repository; where the data needed for each code is stored. Also, there might be some zip files, which contains the compressed data needed for some codes.

#### `Applied_ML` directory: Applied Machine Learning Algorithms

**`Detroit_Blight_Ticket_Compliance_GBC.ipynb`**<br>Is a Jupyter Notebook which treats the 
[Detroit Blight Ticket Compliance Kaggle issue](https://www.kaggle.com/c/detroit-blight-ticket-compliance/overview). The solution is done using 
[Gradient Boost Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting). For the solution, I employ the python libraries `pandas`,`matplotlib`, `numpy`, and 
`sklearn`. 

#### `Text_Mining` directory: Applied Text Analysis Algorithms

**`Date_Recover.ipynb`**<br>Is a Jupyter Notebook which has a code to retrieve different type of date formats to therefore use it to sort a list of events. I employ the python libraries `pandas`, `re`, and `nltk`.

**`MobyDick_analysis.ipynb `**<br>This notebook shows 11 ways to use `nltk`'s functions to study the basic components of text, in this case, the Moby Dick novel.
